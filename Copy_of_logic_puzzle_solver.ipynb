Let me look at the multipliers first: 3, 6, 9, 12. I see that these are multiples of 3. 3 is 3×1, 6 is 3×2, 9 is 3×3, and 12 is 3×4. So the multiplier increases by 3 each time.\n",

It seems like the digit is increasing by 1 each time. So the first result is 1s, then 2s, then 3s, then 4s. Following this pattern, the next should be 5s, making 555, but wait, the last equation is 37 * ? = 777. Wait, that's 7s, not 5s. That's a bit confusing.\n",

Let me test that: 37 * 15. Let me calculate that. 37 * 10 is 370, and 37 * 5 is 185, so 370 + 185 is 555. So 37 * 15 = 555. But the given equation is 37 * ? = 777, which is 7s.

So each result is the digit multiplied by 111. 1×111=111, 2×111=222, 3×111=333, 4×111=444. So the next would be 5×111=555, but the given equation is 777, which is 7×111=777. So that suggests that the multiplier for 37 is increasing by 3 each time, but the digit in the result is increasing by 1 each time. So after 444 (which is 4×111), the next would be 5×111=555, but the given equation is 777, which is 7×111. So that's a jump from 4 to 7, which is an increase of 3. That doesn't fit the previous pattern of increasing by 1 each time.\n",

So 777 is 7×111, which would mean the multiplier is 21 because 37*21=777. Let me check that: 37*20=740, plus 37 is 777. Yes, that's correct.\n",
